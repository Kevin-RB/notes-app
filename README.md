# Notes-app
This web application was created as a personal project to practice and demonstrate my web development skills in addition to adding a new project to my portfolio. This aplication allows users to create, read, update and save notes which can be sorted by a different array of parameters, the notes will remain stored in the user's local storage for future their use 

## About
 - The application was built using JavaScript, Tailwind, Babel and Webpack.
 - Responsive implemented thanks to the TailwindCss utility classes
 - Demo available at : https://kevin-note-app.netlify.app/
